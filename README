server serves as secondary AKA receiver
client serves as primary AKA sender

but you need to run the server first!

first we need to define our frame structure
our frame is a byte big
the first 4 bits are used for data
the middle bit is for nothing (currently)
the last 3 bits are LastFrameIndicator, SeqNo, Parity bit respectively

if it's an ACK/NAK frame, the first bit will be 1 if ACK and 0 if NAK
the remaining 4 bits for data will not be used
the last 3 bits are still the same
